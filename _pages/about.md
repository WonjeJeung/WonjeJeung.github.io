👋 Hello! I'm <span class="blue-text">Wonje Jeung</span>, a first-year Master's student in <span class="blue-text">Artificial Intelligence</span> at <span class="blue-text">Yonsei University</span>, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <span class="blue-text">Albert No</span>.
Previously, I gained valuable research experience working with Professor <span class="blue-text">Jonghyun Choi</span> at both Yonsei University and Seoul National University.


<section class="research-section">
  <h2 class="section-title">Research Interests</h2>
  <p>My research spans three core areas:</p>

  <ul class="research-list">
    <li>
      <strong><span class="blue-text">Privacy, memorization, and unlearning in LLMs</span></strong><br>
      I investigate how large language models store and forget information, with a focus on enabling reliable removal of sensitive or targeted data.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><span class="blue-text">Safety in AI systems</span></strong><br>
      As LLMs are increasingly deployed in agents and robotics, I study <span class="blue-text">safety alignment strategies</span> that ensure consistent and trustworthy behavior.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong><span class="blue-text">Advanced model architectures and learning algorithms</span></strong><br>
      I’m exploring more <span class="blue-text">efficient and high-performing language models</span>, including innovations like <span class="blue-text">Discrete Diffusion</span> and <span class="blue-text">Large Reasoning Models</span>.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>🤝 If these interests resonate with you, feel free to reach out—I'm always open to collaboration!</p>
