👋 Hello! I'm <span class="blue-text">Wonje Jeung</span>, a first-year Master's student in <span class="blue-text">Artificial Intelligence</span> at <span class="blue-text">Yonsei University</span>, where I am fortunate to be advised by Professor <span class="blue-text">Albert No</span>.
Previously, I gained valuable research experience working with Professor <span class="blue-text">Jonghyun Choi</span> at both Yonsei University and Seoul National University. I work on <span class="blue-text">privacy, safety, and reasoning and efficient model architectures</span>. 🤝 If these interests resonate with you, feel free to reach out—I'm always open to collaboration!
